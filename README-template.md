## My process

1. Get familiar with project and understand the goal. Read through design instructions, get an overview of provided project assets.
2. Planning. What does the project require technology wise. Languages, libraries etc.
3. Visualize solution. How will I go about implementing the solution?
4. Code
    1. Get the HTML in place.
    2. Apply style, starting with the canvas and gradually working down to the details.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Got my first attempt at putting responsive design to practice with the use of flexbox. Also got to try my hand properly at detailed element positioning, padding and margins in order to match the project guiding image as close as possible.

### Continued development

This was a simple project to put course theory to practice. For the future I want to keep developing my knowledge surrounding front-end development and modern responsive web design.
